Inspects calls to Permissible->hasPermission() with an undeclared permission name.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Permissions have to be registered in plugin.yml so that permission managers can modify them.</p>
<p>Permissions declared in plugin.yml of the current plugin, the PocketMine source code (in DefaultPermissions.php) and
    in dependency plugins (found in plugin.yml files in project libraries) are automatically included.</p>
<p>If you register the permission nodes dynamically, you may explicitly add them below. You may use wildcard patterns (*
    for 0 to infinite arbitrary characters, ? for one arbitrary character).</p>
